# C++ Practice Core

## Overview
A practice project folder featuring the core utilities of C++ and my personal progress in the programming language. The repository contains a collection of specific projects 
created throughout learning C++, which focuses on the fundamental concepts in C++. The collection contains a variety of projects ranging from basic console I/O operations to 
class inheritance and pointer/reference passing. Each folder represents a different concept I practiced, with time spent understanding the techniques that make C++ 
a strong, lightweight, and flexible programming language.

## Concepts Covered
* Array.cpp – Basic array operations, indexing, and memory handling.
* ClassesAndObjects.cpp – Object-oriented programming fundamentals, class design, and encapsulation.
* CompileVsRuntime.cpp – Exploration of compile-time vs. runtime behavior and error handling.
* ConditionalStatements.cpp – If, else-if, and switch-case conditional statements.
* Constants.cpp – Defining and using constants.
* Debug.cpp – Techniques for debugging, error checking, and program analysis.
* DynamicMemory.cpp – Memory allocation, deallocation, and pointer management with new and delete.
* Enums.cpp – Defining and using enumerations for named constants.
* FunctionPointers.cpp – Using pointers to functions.
* Functions.cpp – Creating, calling, and passing parameters to functions.
* HeapVsStack.cpp – Understanding stack vs. heap memory allocation and lifetime.
* Inheritance.cpp – Class inheritance, base/derived classes, and polymorphism.
* Iterator.cpp – Implementing and using iterators for container traversal.
* Keywords.cpp – Exploring reserved keywords and their correct usage.
* LiteralConstants.cpp – Using literal values in code, including numeric and character constants.
* Loops.cpp – For, while, and do-while loops for iteration.
* MemoryAddress.cpp – Working with addresses, pointers, and memory references.
* Namespaces.cpp – Organizing code and preventing name conflicts with namespaces.
* Numbers.cpp – Using numeric types and performing arithmetic operations.
* Operators.cpp – Operator usage including arithmetic, logical, and relational operations.
* Output.cpp – Console output techniques with cout and formatting.
* PassByValueVSPassByReference.cpp – Exploring the difference between passing arguments by value and by reference.
* Pointers.cpp – Pointer basics, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic.
* Recursion.cpp – Implementing recursive functions and problem-solving patterns.
* SpecialCharConstants.cpp – Using escape sequences and special character constants.
* Strings.cpp – Working with C-style strings and basic string operations.
* Structs.cpp – Defining and using structures for grouped data.
* SwitchCases.cpp – Implementing switch-case statements for multi-way branching.
* Templates.cpp – Generic programming with template functions and classes.
* TypeConversion.cpp – Casting between different data types and implicit vs. explicit conversions.
* TypedefAndUsing.cpp – Type aliasing using typedef and using declarations.
* UserInput.cpp – Reading input from the console and validating user input.
* VariableScope.cpp – Understanding variable lifetime and scope rules.
* VariablesAndDataTypes.cpp – Declaring variables, primitive data types, and type usage.

## Purpose
This repository is not a clean and fully developed library of concepts but rather a personal practice development sandbox featuring my programming progress. Please understand that
the projects within this repository are still in progress, and I have plans to further expand and learn new techniques and tools throughout my journey.
