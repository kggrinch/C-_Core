    // Keywords:

    // unsigned - data type keyword used for types to only represent non-negative values

    // size_t - same as unsigned except using in standard libary functions
    //          designed to represent the sizes of objects in memory.

    // auto - a data type keyword used for type inference, meaning you use it for when
    //        you want the compiler to assign a data type to a variable based on what other
    //        variables your working with.
    // example: auto sum = 1 + 5 - This will assign sum the int data type                
    
    // nullptr - a keyword that works the same as null except it is used to specifically assign pointers to null
    
    // virtual - A keyword used when using abstraction in classes. It is used to 
    //           denote a method is abstract and must be implemented in a sub-class
